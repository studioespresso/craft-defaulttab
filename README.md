# Default Tab for Craft CMS

<img src="http://studioespresso.co/assets/plugins/craft_defaulttab_banner.png">

When building sites with Craft CMS, you've probably done this a couple of times: you create a new section, you go to add fields and the first thing you have to do is add a news tab. Every time. This plugin aims to fix that 🎉.

## Installation

To install Default Tab, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `defaulttab` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
3. The plugin folder should be named `defaulttab` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Default Tab works on Craft 2.4.x, 2.5.x. and 2.6.x

## Settings
- Tab title: set the title for your default tab
- Use title field: enable this give each new section a title field (only applies to Single sections)
